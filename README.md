COVID-19 outbreaks only affect the lives of people, they result in a negative impact on the economy of the country. On Jan. 30, 2020, it was declared as a health emergency for the entire globe by the World Health Organization (WHO). By Apr. 28, 2020, more than 3 million people were infected by this virus and there was no vaccine to prevent. The WHO released certain guidelines for safety, but they were only precautionary measures. The use of information technology with a focus on fields such as data Science and machine learning can help in the fight against this pandemic. It is important to have early warning methods through which one can forecast how much the disease will affect society, on the basis of which the government can take necessary actions without affecting its economy. 

In this Project, we include methods for forecasting future cases based on existing data. Machine learning approaches are used for predicting the chance of being infected and other for forecasting the number of positive cases, are discussed. A trial was done for different algorithms, and the algorithm that gave results with the best accuracy are covered in the Project. 


Dataset:The current dataset has been downloaded from ‘ABC’ government website and contains around 2,78,848 individuals who have gone through the RT-PCR test. Data set contains 11 columns, including 8 features suspected to play an important role in the prediction of COVID19 outcome. Outcome variable is covid result test positive or negative. We have data from 11th March 2020 till 30th April 2020. Data from 11th March to 15th April was used for training and validation and the data from 16th April to 30th April was used as test set.
                   


Dataset contains symptoms of patients which is crucial to identify the infection of covid. Columns are categorical in nature. Details of the columns are :

**A. Basic information:**

ID (Individual ID)

Sex (male/female).

Age ≥60 above years (true/false)

Test date (date when tested for COVID)


**B. Symptoms:**

Cough (true/false).

Fever (true/false).

Sore throat (true/false).

Shortness of breath (true/false).

Headache (true/false).


**C. Other information:**

Known contact with an individual confirmed to have COVID-19 (Abroad/Confirmed/other).

**D. Covid report**

Corona positive or negative
